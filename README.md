The project’s goal is to analyze and visualize, and correlate real-world data sets, such as the world’s population and agricultural land. The World Bank is where the data source is from. By using various libraries and a collection of choropleth maps showing the percentage of the world's agricultural land over various time frames, weather conditions, and population distributions. I opted for three different shades to represent the choropleth maps' agriculture land, ranging from good to medium to low: yellow, green, and blue.

 Employed technology: python, textblob, numpy, matplotlib, geo pandas, and pandas.
